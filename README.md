## 👋 About Me

Hi everyone, I'm Marine—welcome to my GitHub!

🌍 Based in Bordeaux, France, I’m lucky to live in the heart of the wine country, just an hour from the ocean! 🌊🍇

## 🚀 My Journey So Far

I’m a freelance Data Analyst specializing in business and financial analytics and reporting.

🎓 After studying Markets and Corporate Finance at the Sorbonne in Paris, I graduated with a degree in Financial Engineering in 2020. I started my career as a Financial Valuation Analyst at KPMG, but I quickly realized that data analytics would be the key to unlocking even more insights in my work. A coding journey soon followed, leading me to complete a Data Science bootcamp with Le Wagon and eventually land in my dream city—Bordeaux!

📈 I later joined Once For All, a SaaS company, as a Finance Data Analyst, where I was responsible for building a new financial reporting environment during a major merger with multiple French entities.

Today, I’m back to freelancing! This role allows me to balance my passion for data with my love of yoga, keeping both my mind and body at peak performance. 🧘‍♀️💡

💼 In addition to freelancing, I teach data analytics and data science across various platforms, including businesses, universities, and individual coaching. Teaching lets me share what I know, continue learning, and stay current with industry trends.
